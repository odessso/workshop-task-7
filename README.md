Using objects, specifically in the context of creating simulations.

## Notes:
- I am really inspired by the idea of creating objects that could essentially mill around on their own randomly. It reminds me of a simple version of videogame npcs which is super interesting to work with. Sadly I didn't have enough time to truly explore what I wanted to within this workshop, however I hope to come back to it in future maybe within the next exquisite corpse file I do. For this task I wanted to create an abstract version of Monet's water lily garden by having the random walkers only walk round certain areas of the canvas. I worked with what I could do and decided to add a background made of two different colours and then have the walkers essentially switch the colour.

## Problems:
- This was quite troublesome however I was able to work out how to atleast get the walkers working on two halves of the canvas separately by constraining their movements. I was not able to make walkers successfully walk round in the shape of Monet's bridge, or get walkers to be lily pads (as the other walkers kept covering up the lilypad walker progress)
